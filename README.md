# hcde310a21-final_project

Due: 16 December, 4:30pm

# Please turn in: 

# all of your code. 
You do not have to turn in your API keys, but you must include instructions on where and how to get any API keys so that we can grade this. A link to your repository is fine so long as we have access. 

# a video that demos your project. 
We will share publicly posted videos with the class and use them to help grade, and you can use it to show off your work in the future, even if the API(s) you used go down or change.

Your video should be 1-2 minutes long and describe the problem your app solves and demonstrate how it adds value. If you are stuck on how to do that, common techniques include either (a) a before and after scenario (e.g., accomplishing a task with and without your application) or (b) presenting a scenario and showing how someone would use the app to accomplish a task.

It can also be valuable to reflect for part of the video on what you are most proud of achieving in the project or the hardest technical problem you had to solve.

if your project changed substantially from your proposal, a *short* and informal reflection on what you learned (a paragraph to a page). If you submitted a revised project proposal, you do not need to do this.

# How to turn this in:
Create a GitHub repository. If you would like a free pro account while a student (necessary for private repositories), see this link to the Github Student Developer Pack (Links to an external site.). 
If your repository is private, please give instructors permissions to access it. Github usernames: smunson, ShengzhiW, VS511, tianyi33, uwmdm, ben-olson, Kenny-You. You can also add us when you create the repository, which might help if we're working with you to debug in office hours or lab time!
Use Canvas to turn in: 
A link to the video (in the URL field) 
A link to your GitHub repository in the comments
A one page max description of how your project changed (if it changed substantially) as an upload
If we need API keys to run your project, please include them if possible (e.g., if they are in a secrets.py, just upload that). 
If you are willing to share your video publicly, please also add it to this document. (link coming later)
Did you work in a team? Please have only one of you turn this in and the other should just leave a submission comment in Canvas, for example "See Yihan Yu's submission for our project." 

The due date is December 16th. If you need a little flexibility, we can do that (the end of the quarter is hard! and it will take us a few days to get through grading anyway). We shouldn't have a problem grading everything that is turned in by Friday afternoon. Later than that can be harder for us, but if it makes a difference in your quality of life with the end of the quarter, please check in with Sean rather than assuming we can't do anything.
